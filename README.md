# MindCast

![Preview-Screens]()

If you want to take a look on all screens of the App, they are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rXFlogxaT5E0pthrrLhF1D_wOVbSHwhD).

## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Share knowledge in the form of podcasts, providing a simple way to learn"._

**PS:** Podcasts was just the context chosen by me for this project, but all the code inside this app can be reused for any app that has audio-streaming as domain, so you can reuse everything here in your next music-player, podcast-library or anything inside this context!

**On the Media ðŸ¤©:** A [review](https://youtu.be/nu8mwGZUBFU) about this app (pt-BR ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## Some Observations about this App

1 - There's no functionality of Login/Register, the buttons and the forms in the Login Screen are only for UI matters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a React-Native App, that can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Also, you'll need to the server running locally on your machine with the mock data. You can find the server and all the instructions to start the server [here](https://github.com/steniowagner/mindcast-server).

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/steniowagner/mindCast

$ cd mindCast
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ yarn
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

### Connecting the App with the Server

1 - Follow the instructions on the [mindcast-server](https://github.com/steniowagner/mindcast-server) to have the server up and running on your machine.

2 - With the server up and running, go to the [/.env.development](https://github.com/steniowagner/mindCast/blob/master/.env.development) file and edit the SERVER_URL value for the IP of your machine (you can have some issues with _localhost_ if you're running on an android physical device, but you can use localhost safely on iOS).

It should looks like this:

SERVER_URL=http://**_IP_OF_YOUR_MACHINE_**:3001/mind-cast/api/v1

*or*

SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001/mind-cast/api/v1

### Running

With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app:

Android

```
$ react-native run-android
```

iOS

```
$ react-native run-ios
```
