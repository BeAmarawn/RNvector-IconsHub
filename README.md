## About this Project

IconsHub - React Native is an open source project and an easy way to view, explore and save icons for your React Native projects!

The app encapsulates the [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library, for React Native. You can search manually or use the search bar to find more than 10,000 icons made available in [React-Native-Vector-Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).

Every day I feel that the community develops incredible things that make my job easier and faster. So when I feel that something can make life easier for other developers and mine too, I know I need to make my contribution to make this happen.
